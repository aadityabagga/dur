#Use cases for dur.c
#Developed by Aaditya Bagga

Some places where dur can be used-

1.)To find the last upgrade time with pacman.

A bash function for it-

function lastupt()
{
        updated=`grep upgraded /var/log/pacman.log |tac|head -n 1|cut -c 2-11`
        today=`date +%F`
        echo "Last update was`dur $updated $today` ago"
}

This can be added to ~/.bashrc and called with $ lastup


2.)As a reminder manager.

a)A script for it-

#!/bin/bash
#A script to act as a reminder

	eventname="Exam"        
	eventdate="2013-12-08"
	today=`date +%F`
	
	echo "$eventname is`dur $today $eventdate` away"
	read	#To wait for the user to close it.
	exit 0

The eventname and eventdate can be modified.
The above script can be added to autostart, so that the reminder is displayed at every boot.

for eg, I have added this the following in my autostart
	 xterm -e "/home/aaditya/scripts/remind"

b)To be displayed as a Conky element

I have the following in my ~/.conkyrc
	${font Cantarell:size=12}Exam: $alignr ${execi 3600 dur `date +%F` 2013-12-08}

Here Exam is the name of the event, and 2013-12-08 is the date of the event, ie exam.
This updates itself every hour, or 3600 seconds.
